	<h1> What is Going on This Time? </h1>
	<h2> Yesterday, Venezuela burned. Today it will burn again.</h2>
	<h3> By Mischka Capriles </h3>
	<h3> April 20th </h3>
	<p> Millions across the country are protesting against Nicolas Maduro ﾌ《 authoritarian dictatorship, and are attacked for doing so. Repression is the rule against dissent. It is how the Armed Forces, supposed to defend democracy, are reacting to demonstrators who demand their rights be respected and their needs be heard. They protest because they cannot find anything to eat; they protest because there are no medicines to cure major and minor diseases; they protest because they live in constant fear of being mugged, kidnapped or killed. They protest because of government inefficiency, corruption, and tyranny.
Last week the National Assembly, the only remaining democratic institution, was dissolved. Shortly after, an opposition leader was banned from political workfor 15 years. This is just a small example compared to politicians, like Leopoldo Lopez, who have been in jail for years, or Juan Requesens who was beaten for demanding change.
Although the assembly was reinstalled after three days because of protests, the riots continued and there was massive repression.
Six died in last week ﾌ《 protest, while hundreds were injured and detained. Yesterday, two were killed; one of them was a young 17-year-old boy, and the other was 23-year-old girl. The body count rises to 57 injured and 400 detained.
Tear gas was fired against protesters all over Vene- zuela, and water cannons persecuted protesters across the streets. 
In the capital city of Caracas, people jumped into a river to avoid being affected by the gas or seen by police forces. All over the country, people felt the for of a government trying to silence them by inciting fear through vio- lence. Nevertheless, Venezuelans will regroup and march again today, and every other day after that until the government gives its people the democ- racy they deserves, and calls for timely elections.
Venezuelans no longer want to live in the world ﾌ《 most dangerous country, or the country with the world ﾌ《 highest inflation rate (741%). They want to be able to find food and ac- tually afford it. They want freedom to express their ideals without being per- secuted and put behind bars like Lopez was. Ven- ezuelawantsuncensored media. Venezuela wants to be heard. Venezuelans NEED to be heard, because they want the peace that is brutally and violently being taken away from them, back. </p>
