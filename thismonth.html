<h1> Letter from the Editor </h1>
<p> Over 2 million Venezuelans have left the country in the last couple of years. </p>
<p> Most of us left to escape the reality of the country. A reality in which we no longer wanted to or could live in, but certainly did not and do not want to forget. </p>
<p> Venezuela Vive brings information to thousands of Venezuelans that for one reason or another ended up in NY but keep their native country close to their hearts and in their minds. 
It is also directed to those who perhaps did not get a chance to live in one of the world's most beautiful countries; but have encountered with its lively people, delicious food, magical landscapes or simply stumbled upon and was interested in the devastating news of its crisis. 
In our news section, we will offer a monthly roundup of the most important things happening back home. </p>
<p> Every month, we will deliver a in deep feature of a politician, government official, leader, businessman, entrepreneur, bolichico, testaferro, boliburgues or someone that is doing something noteworthy, or specific in depth case. Features will be supported by investigation. We will deliver exceptional pieces on the people or events shaping our home country, to help you understand who or what they are, where they come from, and what it is they are doing. </p>
<p> In "Vzla in NY" we offer those interested in connecting with their community here, news on events, restaurants and anything that has to do with the Venezuelan community in NY. </p>
<p> "Siempre habra Vzla", is a name stolen by a book that compiled all the editorial notes by my grandfather in his newspaper back in Venezuela. I took the liberty of reusing the name, and making it the title of a section that will breath prosperity and hope. Regardless of the crisis, the country keeps running, and people, although in a tough situation, continue to live there. As the title says, "There Will Always Be Vzla", countries do not end. People continue to grow, innovate, learn and do positive things. In Siempre habra Vzla we will forget the crisis, and cover people who are starting companies, selling products, winning prices and putting on shows. We will look beyond this dark hole and will see the light at the end of the tunnel. </p>
